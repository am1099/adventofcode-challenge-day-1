# adventofcode-challenge-day-1
Each year a code challenge event takes place called Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com). On December 1st each year the website releases a new daily challenge and this continues up until Christmas day on day 25. Each daily challenge consists of two parts, where the second part of the challenge is revealed upon completion of the first part.
